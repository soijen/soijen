  <div class="callout-copy">
    <p>We are Jess and Eduardo. We come from very different backgrounds, but together we share a love for the outdoors, especially for Chilean Patagonia.</p>
    <p>We draw our inspiration from the <em>Selk’nam</em> – the indigenous people of southern Patagonia. The <em>Selk’nam</em> were nomadic hunters, traveling by foot across the desolate landscapes at the end of the world. When they crossed paths, they celebrated with unique footraces called <em>káiyik</em>, sprinting around lakes or racing to the tops of hills. The winner was the <em>sóijen</em> – or champion runner.</p>
    <p>We are inspired by this collective passion for the outdoors, especially when it comes to running on trails and in the mountains. Through <em>Sóijen</em> we want to share our experiences in Patagonia, giving you the most complete information so you can start your own journey.</p>
    <p>Welcome to <em>Sóijen</em>, your resource for Patagonia unexplored.</p>
