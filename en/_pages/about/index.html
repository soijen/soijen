  <h2>About Sóijen</h2>
  <p>At Sóijen, we are first and foremost outdoor adventurers with a passion for the wind-swept peaks and icy fjords of southern Patagonia. We design products that inspire fellow adventurers to get out and explore off-the-beaten-path areas in Patagonia.</p>
  <p>Our products are made with recycled materials and partnerships with environmentally-conscience vendors. We support and collaborate with local agencies and environmental initiatives to preserve and protect this one-of-a-kind region.</p>
  <h3>What does <em>Sóijen</em> mean?</h3>
  <p>We drew inspiration for our name from the <em>Selk’nam</em> – the indigenous people of southern Patagonia. The <em>Selk’nam</em> were nomadic hunters, traveling by foot across the desolate landscapes at the end of the world. When they crossed paths, they celebrated with unique footraces called <em>káiyik</em>, sprinting around lakes or racing to the tops of hills. The winner was the <em>sóijen</em> – or champion runner.</p>

  <h2>Get Inspired. Go Outside. & Give Back.</h2>
  <p>Each year we donate a percentage of our profits to support environmental initiatives in Chile. In 2018 we partnered with <a href="https://www.reforestemos.cl/en/el-proyecto/" title="Fundación Reforestemos" target="_blank">Fundación Reforestemos</a>, a non profit dedicated to recovering degraded ecosystems in Patagonia and other areas in Chile. You too can help grow our forest by following this <a href="http://www.reforestemos.cl/bosques/soijen/" title="Sóijen Forest" target="_blank">link</a> and making a donation.</p>
