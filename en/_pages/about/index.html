  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>We draw our inspiration from the <em>Selk’nam</em> – the indigenous people of southern Patagonia. The <em>Selk’nam</em> were nomadic hunters, traveling by foot across the desolate landscapes at the end of the world. When they crossed paths, they celebrated with unique footraces called <em>káiyik</em>, sprinting around lakes or racing to the tops of hills. The winner was the <em>sóijen</em> – or champion runner.</p>
  <p>At Sóijen, we are first and foremost outdoor adventurers with a passion for these wind-swept peaks and icy fjords of southern Patagonia.</p>
  <p>Through our unique products & designs, we promote off-the-beaten-path areas in Patagonia.</p>
  <p>We collaborate with local agencies and environmental initiatives to preserve and protect this one-of-a-kind region.</p>
