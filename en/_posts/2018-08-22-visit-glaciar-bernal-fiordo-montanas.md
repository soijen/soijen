Of all the glaciars that call Fiordo de las Montañas their home, Glaciar Bernal is definitely one of our favorites. It is located about 20 minutes by boat from the floating refuge of our friends at <a href="http://www.patagonianfjords.com/" target="_blank">Patagonian Fjords Expeditions</a>. We were happy to test out the newly inaugurated short trail leading to panoramic viewpoints of the glaciar.

<h2>Background</h2>
- <strong>Trek:</strong> Out-and-back to Glaciar Bernal
- <strong>Total Distance:</strong> 1.5 km
- <strong>Location:</strong> Reserva Nacional Alacalufes, Chile (see <a href="#map">map</a> below)
- <strong>Closest City:</strong> Puerto Natales, Chile

<h2>Route Description</h2>
The trek starts with a short boat ride rrom the floating refuge in Bahía de los Huiros. The trail to the base of the glaciar is new and very easy to follow. During our visit our friend Héctor mentioned the glaciar has been noticeably retreating, and changing the landscape in its wake.
