The dramatic landscape of Fiordo de las Montañas was carved by the retreating glaciers of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. This fjord is also part of the Reserva Nacional Kawésqar, one of the largest protected areas in Chilean Patagonia. It is located to the west of Puerto Natales, and it is a rarely visited area in the region. In January 2018 our friends at <a href="http://www.patagonianfjords.com/" target="_blank">Patagonian Fjords Expeditions</a> invited us to discover this remote and inhospitable place.

<h2>Description</h2>

Our trip began at the docks of Puerto Natales, where we boarded a boat which would take us the 2 hour journey to Bahía de los Huiros, where the floating refuge "Explorador" is docked. "Explorador" would be our home for the next 3 days. It's fully equipped with everything you could need, including a friendly and professional crew and freshly baked bread. The perfect base for our adventures in Fiordo de las Montañas together with Héctor and his team at Patagonian Fjords Expeditions.

Our 3 day exploration of the Fiordo de las Montañas, is divided into 3 posts:
