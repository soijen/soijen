In the third leg of our <a href="/tierra-del-fuego-van-overview/">8-day overland trip of Tierra del Fuego</a>, we will introduce you to the region of Timaukel. If you haven't already, read <a href="/TDF-part-2-cerro-sombrero-cameron/">Part 2</a> of this series.

<h2>Cameron</h2>
The small hamlet of Cameron is located slightly after the intersection of route Y-85 and Y-897. Cameron is the municipal seat of the Timaukel region of Tierra del Fuego and has about 60 inhabitants. This picturesque coastal village deserves a short detour if only to snap a couple of photos of life in this southern extreme of the world.
Tip: Take advantage of the public restrooms in the main square with a large utility sink to wash up some pots and plates from lunch. We were told there is a small minimarket somewhere in town, but couldn't actually find it (likely it was closed for the Christmas holidays).

<h2>A Note on Sleeping Arrangements in Tierra del Fuego</h2>
In general we found it tough to find a secluded place to sleep north of Pampa Guanaco, because the majority of the roads are bordered by fences marking the beginning of private estancias (ranches).  

<h2> Russfin </h2>
Russfin is a sawmill approximately halfway between Cameron and Pampa Guanaco. Most importantly this is your last stop for gas (in Chile) as you make your to the south of the island. They also offer basic car maintenance and lodging options. Check out their <a href="https://www.paradorrussfin.cl/">website</a> (spanish only) for hours and more information.

We arrived to Russfin to fill our tank only to discover they had run out of diesel, due to the volume of people travelling for the holidays. That was a huge blow to our plan. We still had over half a tank and an extra 20-L container, which we had filled in Cerro Sombrero. After some quick calculations we decided we would continue on with our plan with the fuel we had left, and cross our fingers that Russfin would have diesel on our return.
