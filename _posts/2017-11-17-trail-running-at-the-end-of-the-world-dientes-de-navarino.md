Our first post on sóijen! And what better way to inaugurate our new blog then to write about our latest adventure at the end of the world.

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul class="post-stats bullets">
<li><strong>Trek:</strong> Los Dientes de Navarino circuit</li>
<li><strong>Total Distance:</strong> 40 km (32 km trails, 8 km dirt road)</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Isla Navarino, Chile
Closest City: Puerto Williams</li>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> (?)</li>
</ul>

The duration is a best described by a question mark because it depends on what type of experience you are looking for. The trek is traditionally done as a 3-5 day backpacking trip. Our style was to go ultralight and complete it in one day.

<h2>The Challenges</h2>
<ol>
<li>Route finding – the trail has 38 official markers and is otherwise indicated only by cairns, when you’re lucky.</li>
<li>Mud – infamous Patagonian turba (peat).
Weather – this is Patagonia. You can experience all four seasons in one day.</li>

<h2>Our Experience</h2>

We began the trek at 5:20 AM on December 8, 2016 from Plaza de la Vírgen in Puerto Williams. We chose the route up Cerro Bandera (on the left) and followed it until Laguna del Salto. What’s impressive about this trek is how drastically the landscape changes. After Laguna del Salto, we ascended and hit snow in Paso Primero and then Paso Australia. The traverse was incredibly beautiful but the route finding difficult as we tried to find the next cairn while sometimes knee deep in snow.

As we reached the third snowy mountain pass – Paso de los Dientes – we integrated a new member to our team. Navarino appeared completely out of nowhere, but a welcome surprise! Who would expect a dog to suddenly appear in the middle of the mountains?

Navarino quickly became not only the third teammate in our adventure, but our trail angel. Although the weather cleared behind Los Dientes and we trekked under blue skies, the route was wild and difficult to follow. But Navarino, our guide, knew exactly where to go. We redistributed our food for three and took more frequent breaks to give Navarino some love and encouraging hugs.
